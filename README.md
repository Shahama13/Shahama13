👋 Hi, I'm Shahama! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

👀 I'm interested in web development and currently focused on learning the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. I'm passionate about building web applications and exploring the various aspects of full-stack development.

🌱 I'm currently in the process of learning and enhancing my skills in web development. I have already made significant progress and am now halfway through my MERN stack learning journey. As part of my learning process, I'm actively working on building projects and gaining practical experience, which helps me solidify my understanding of the concepts and technologies involved.

💞️ I'm excited about collaborating on web development projects that involve the MERN stack. I believe that collaboration is key to growth and learning, and I'm eager to work with like-minded individuals or teams to create impactful and innovative web applications.

📫 If you'd like to reach out to me, feel free to connect with me on GitHub. You can find me at @Shahama13. I'm open to discussions, project collaborations, or any web development-related conversations.

Let's code, learn, and build together! 🚀
